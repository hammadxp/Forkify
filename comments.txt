Classes are used as a blueprint to create objects, so why are we using a 'class' here?
Maybe just to contain methods outside global scope
Or for just an object of methods

Now I know why we used a class here
Because with export command, we can either export individual functions or a single default export
Also, we would need to add 'export' keyword before every function, imagine exporting 100s of functions
So we used class to create an object which contains all kinds of different methods that we want to export
But why not create the object without class and export that object?
